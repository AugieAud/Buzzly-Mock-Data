      "body": "The Council can’t just assume what we want when they’re designing parks, hangout spaces, or facilities. A lot of the time, they build stuff that looks cool but doesn’t get used because they never asked us what we actually need. Parks shouldn’t just be about swings and benches—they should have skate parks, basketball courts, or even chill zones with Wi-Fi where we can hang out with our mates. Spaces for music, art, or pop-up events could also bring people together and make the area feel alive. And it’s not just about what’s in the park—it’s about how it feels. Does it have shade? Is it safe? Is it somewhere we’d actually want to be?\nThe Council could set up an app or website where we can vote on designs, suggest ideas, and even upload sketches or photos of what we think would work. For example, if they’re renovating a park in our area, we should be able to pick from a few design options or suggest something new. They could also run workshops or pop-up booths in schools, malls, or libraries where we can give quick feedback. If we’re involved from the start and can see our ideas being used, we’ll actually feel like the Council is building Auckland with us, not for us.",

Additionally, recreational facilities like basketball courts, yoga spaces, or even open areas for events like markets or music nights would help foster community among young people.\nTo ensure these spaces meet our needs, the Council should engage students early in the planning process. This could be done through interactive surveys, open design competitions, or focus groups held on campuses. Hosting pop-up consultation events at universities would also allow students to provide real-time feedback on upcoming projects. By making the process transparent and allowing students to track how their input is shaping final decisions, the Council can create spaces that we not only use but also feel proud to have contributed to.",

The current approach often feels like it’s designed for older generations, with overly formal reports, inaccessible meetings, and jargon-filled updates. To engage students, the Council should use platforms we already use daily—Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and university-specific portals. They could create concise, visually appealing content, such as infographics that break down key decisions, short videos explaining upcoming projects, and interactive Q&A sessions where we can directly ask questions.\nAdditionally, the Council should partner with student organisations and clubs to deliver information in spaces where students already engage. For example, hosting panel discussions on campus about how decisions like public transport changes or urban planning will affect us. A regular newsletter tailored to students, with actionable steps on how we can get involved, would also go a long way. By recognising that we are a critical demographic with valuable insights, the Council can build a stronger connection and foster genuine interest in local governance.",

We're the future of this city, and we deserve a say in how it's shaped.\n\nThe Problem\n\nRight now, it feels like the Council is talking at us, not with us. Their meetings are boring, their language is confusing, and their plans don't always reflect our needs. We need a change!\n\nThe Solution\n\nLet's make the Council more relevant and engaging for young people. Here's how:\n\nDigital First:\n\nSocial Media Squad: Create a dedicated social media team to interact with young people on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat.\n\nInteractive Websites: Design user-friendly websites with quizzes, polls, and comment sections to gather feedback.\n\nLivestream Events: Broadcast council meetings and public consultations live on platforms like Twitch or YouTube.\n\nYouth Advisory Boards:\n\nEmpower Young Voices: Establish youth advisory boards to provide direct input on council decisions.\n\nDiverse Representation: Ensure that these boards represent a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nGamify the Process:\n\nCity-Building Simulations: Develop online games where young people can design and plan their ideal city.\n\nChallenge Competitions: Host competitions for young people to come up with innovative solutions to urban challenges.\n\nYouth-Friendly Language:\n\nSimple and Clear: Use plain language and avoid jargon in all communications.\n\nVisual Appeal: Incorporate visuals, memes, and short videos to make information more engaging.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy embracing these ideas, the Council can create a more inclusive and youth-friendly environment. Let's work together to build a better Auckland for everyone.\n\nCall to Action:\n\nFollow us on social media for updates and to share your ideas.\n\nJoin our online forums to discuss issues and propose solutions.\n\nContact your local councilor to express your concerns and suggestions.\n\nLet's make our voices heard and shape the future of Auckland!",

These groups could meet regularly, pitch ideas, and vote on things that directly affect us—like public transport, parks, and events.\nThe meetings shouldn’t feel stiff and corporate either. Hold them at places we like, like cafes, libraries, or community hubs, and make the environment welcoming. And let’s be real: if you want teens to show up and take it seriously, you need to give us some incentives. Free food, free transport to the meetings, and even small payments for our time would show us that you value our input. To make it even more impactful, let us see the results of our ideas—whether that’s a new basketball court at a park or an event that we helped organise.

In history class, we could reenact important events or do scavenger hunts to uncover clues about how people lived in the past. Science could be all about experiments, like creating potions or growing plants in a mini greenhouse.\nTeachers could make each subject feel like a new mission for us to complete, turning lessons into fun challenges where we learn by doing. They could even let us pick what kind of “adventure” we want to take part in each week, giving us more say in how we learn. If schools asked for our input on what activities would make learning fun and creative, we’d all be way more excited to show up every day. Learning through adventures wouldn’t just be more engaging; it’d help us remember what we learn because we’d be experiencing it firsthand.",

For art, there could be huge walls where we’re allowed to paint and draw anything we want, or digital tablets to make cool animations. Outdoor classrooms could be used for subjects like biology, where we learn about plants and animals by observing them in real life.\nEven small changes would make a big difference, like having comfy chairs, colourful walls, or places to sit in groups. Libraries could have gaming zones with educational games, and computer labs could have spaces where we learn coding by building robots or apps. If schools made these spaces less like offices and more like creative zones, we’d be excited to spend time there.

In history, we could create projects like making a documentary about a historical event or building models of ancient cities.

For example, we could run clubs or workshops where students teach each other about things we’re passionate about, like coding, cooking, or filmmaking. There could even be “student choice days” where we design our own schedules based on the activities and subjects we find most interesting.

Business and communications students could design campaigns to promote these projects, creating an interdisciplinary approach that mirrors how things work in the real world.\nThese projects could be tied to internships or competitions where the best ideas are implemented. Universities should also connect students with professionals from different industries through guest lectures, mentorship programs, or collaborative workshops. This would allow us to learn directly from people working in the fields we’re studying, giving us a clearer idea of how our education applies to our future careers.

For example, a student studying computer science could focus more on AI or cybersecurity, while someone in business studies could dive deeper into social entrepreneurship or digital marketing.\nFlexibility should also extend to how classes are delivered. Universities could offer hybrid models where students can attend lectures in person, online, or even watch recordings later. This would make it easier for students balancing work, family, or other commitments. Finally, schools need to adapt teaching methods based on student feedback. Regular surveys or forums could give students a chance to voice their preferences, like wanting more hands-on projects or interactive lessons. By giving us more control over what and how we learn, universities would create an environment where students feel supported and motivated to succeed.",
